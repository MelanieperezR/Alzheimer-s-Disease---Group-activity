# Code Dashboard Alzheimer

## Tendencia Temporal

This section presents a time series analysis of the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease over the years. Using historical data, we can visualize trends that may indicate how the prevalence has changed over time. This analysis will help in understanding the increasing burden of Alzheimer’s disease on society.

### Implementation
- Data Collection: Gather historical prevalence data from reliable sources.
- Data Processing: Clean and format the data for analysis.
- Visualization: Use time series plotting libraries to visualize the data.
- Interpretation: Analyze the trends observed from the visualizations.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data frame creation
# df = pd.read_csv('path_to_data.csv')
# plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
# plt.plot(df['Year'], df['Prevalence'])
# plt.title('Alzheimer Disease Prevalence Over Years')
# plt.xlabel('Year')
# plt.ylabel('Prevalence')
# plt.show()
```

By implementing this section, we aim to provide insights into how the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease has changed over the years. This will be crucial for future research and planning of healthcare resources.
